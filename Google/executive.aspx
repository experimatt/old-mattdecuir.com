            Google's mission is to organize the world's information
            and make it universally accessible and useful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>From the beginning, Google had a lofty goal, but as time has passed, Google
            has without a doubt shown its potential.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
            Leading the search engine industry in market share, Google is one of the largest
            and fastest growing technology companies in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Driven by advertising revenues, Google has gained success by providing relevant
            search results while also offering advertisements which are related to the content
            of each specific web page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
            Google offers a variety of free services and products, ranging from a myriad of
            free search services, to Google Maps, to services available for mobile phones.<span
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because these services draw millions
            of users to Google’s websites every day, advertising revenues provide a steady stream
            of income.
          </div>
          <div class="mainreport">Google has posted significant growth rates over the past
            five years, resulting in a stock price of more than $500.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>While the market values Google’s stock at $504.77 as of June 12th,
            predicted valuation based on free cash flows shows that it is slightly overvalued
            by less than 0.3%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite lofty predictions
            and great potential for the future, Google’s stock price should only be valued at
            $503.32, which is based on free cash flow estimates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This report may represent a conservative estimate, as Crystal Ball analysis shows that given specific assumptions, Google’s stock price could range from under
            $100, to more than $30,000 per share.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
            Overall, Google has tremendous potential as a company, while constant innovation
            may prove to be the cornerstone of Google’s continued success in the future.
