            In the beginning, Google was nothing more than a research
            project developed by two Stanford graduate students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In 1996, Sergey Brin and Larry Page had developed a search engine with a
            unique method of ranking search results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
            As the need for a relevant search engine on the internet became clearer and clearer,
            Brin and Page registered the Google.com domain in 1997 and officially formed Google,
            Inc. on September 7, 1998.&nbsp; Google had an advantage over other
            search engines at the time because their search results were ranked in a relevant
            manner; based on the number of sites linking to each specific page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Because of the high quality search results and their simple approach to searching,
            Google’s popularity has grown substantially over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Along with their growth in popularity, Google has grown to employ more than
            10,000 people worldwide, while also being ranked as the best company to work for
            by Fortune Magazine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The term ‘google’
            was derived from a misspelling of the word ‘googol,’ which refers to 10<sup>100</sup>,
            and the name stuck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, due to the
            popularity of the world ‘google,’ Merriam-Webster added the term to their dictionary
            defining google as “to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the
            Internet.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As ‘googling’ things became
            more commonplace, Google’s revenues grew tremendously through the use of advertisements.<span
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although Google’s advertising revenues
            have risen every year in the past five years, Google went public on
            <st1:date day="19" month="8" year="2004">August 19, 2004</st1:date>
            , offering 19,605,052 shares at $85 per share.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Since then, Google’s stock price has ascended to more than $500 in early
            2007.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While Google’s initial market
            capitalization was roughly $1.7 billion, that figure has ballooned to more than
            $157 billion in subsequent years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
            addition, Google has made many acquisitions to allow for continued innovation.            
        </div>
        <div class="mainreport">
            While Google has acquired more than 30 companies since
            its inception, a few important ones stick out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In 2003, the acquisition of Applied Semantics, Inc further developed their
            advertising campaign, allowing for advertisements relevant to the context of each
            page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In early 2006, Writely, a web-based
            word processing firm, was acquired, which laid the ground work for Google Docs to
            be released.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In late 2006, Google outbid
            other competitors to acquire Youtube for $1.65 billion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The Youtube acquisition is interesting because since then, both the website
            and the company of the popular video site have remained unchanged, almost remaining
            a completely separate entity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In early
            2007, Google acquired DoubleClick, a large advertising competitor for $3.1 billion.<span
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since then, anti-trust issues have arisen
            and there has not been much development as a result.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Around the same time, Google acquired Tonic Systems, which is used for adapting
            Microsoft PowerPoint files into html and PDF documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This   is significant because, when paired with web-based document and spreadsheet
            software, Google will be actively competing with Microsoft Office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Since then, a few other acquisitions have been made, but they mostly have
            been for internal company use, including video conferencing, graphics optimization,
            and security software.
