            While Google accounts for nearly 50% of the market share
            of all searches on the internet, it has a few main competitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Yahoo is the biggest competitor by far, at around 28.5% but Microsoft isn’t
            too far behind with 10%, while other competitors include Ask.com and AOL, 
            which both hold around 5% market share.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
            Because of the variety of Google’s products and services offered, it is hard to
            target one main competitor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yahoo is
            the most comparable firm because they provide a variety of similar services, such
            as search, advertising, e-mail, maps, and the Yahoo toolbar, but they do not compete
            in many of Google’s other respects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
            Microsoft on the other hand offers search, a few online services, but their focus
            has mainly been on software and operating systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Google has recently grown into competition with Microsoft through Google
            Docs &amp; Spreadsheets, along with development of presentation software and a product
            which may eventually compete with Microsoft Windows, Google Gears. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                &nbsp;</span>Furthermore, through internal development and acquisitions, Google
            will most likely expand the products and services it offers to compete in completely
            different markets, not just software, and web-based services.
