            Google is an innovative internet firm which started as
            a simple research project.&nbsp; Through years of growth and innovation, Google has evolved 
            into an internet-based powerhouse, rivaling that of Microsoft and Yahoo.&nbsp; Partly 
            because of their relevant search results, and also partly because of their
            simple and user-friendly approach to searching, Google has grown to be the most
            frequently used search engine in the world.&nbsp; Google maintains its competitive market
            position by continually developing new services and technologies, while also acquiring
            other small firms with great potential.&nbsp; Google earns 99% of its revenues through 
            advertising, which are unique because the ads displayed on a page are relevant to the 
            content of that specific page.&nbsp; Additionally, funded by advertisements, Google 
            is able to offer a number of free services, which range from free web-based e-mail 
            to maps to mobile services for cell phones.&nbsp; These services attract
            end-user attention, which is the basis for advertising revenue.

            As Google has continued to grow, their stock price has continually risen, eclipsing
            the $500 mark in early 2007.&nbsp; More recently
            however, despite reaching an all time high, Google’s stock has dropped slightly
            to a market price of $504.77.&nbsp; This
            market price is overvalued by only $1.45, based on forecasts of free cash flows,
            which resulted in a predicted share price of $503.32.&nbsp; The future for Google holds 
            great uncertainty, as growth is still high, but
            slowly decreasing, while at the same time, new products continue to be brought to
            market.&nbsp; The future may hold unmatched
            success as Google provides free web-based services to billions of users around the
            world, while also branching slowly into new and unexpected markets.&nbsp; Alternatively, 
            Google could also fail like so many technology firms which came before it.&nbsp; However, only time
            will tell.
