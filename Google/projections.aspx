                    Google has substantial growth remaining for future years.&nbsp; The projected income statement, 
                    <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit8.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 8</a></span>
                    , shows that in the next three years, Google’s sales will increase
                    to $16.532 billion in 2007, $25.726 billion in 2008, and $39.791 billion in 2009.&nbsp; 
                    Beyond that, in 2016, their sales are projected to be at $155.388 billion, reaching $253.398 billion 
                    in 2026.&nbsp; These sales figures use growth rates determined by a logistic growth function,
                    shown in <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit9.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 9</a></span>.&nbsp; 
                    Furthermore, using a trend function for cost of goods sold and selling, general,
                    and administrative costs yielded accurate projections because, it takes fixed and
                    variable costs into account.&nbsp; No information is known about non-operating income 
                    and interest expense in the future, so the projections show no change.&nbsp; Also, a 35% tax rate
                    is assumed, based on previous income tax figures.&nbsp; The logistic growth function in 
                    <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit9.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 9</a></span> 
                    assumes that 20% of Google’s supernormal growth remains, as well as an
                    initial growth rate of 56%, a perpetual growth rate of 5% and 7 years until supernormal
                    growth dissipates.&nbsp; The resulting graph
                    shows the gradual decrease in sales growth, leveling off at 5%, roughly 12 years
                    into the future.&nbsp; The projected common
                    size analysis, <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit10.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 10</a></span>,
                    shows that over the next 20 years, cost of goods sold maintains a level of roughly 40% of sales,
                    while SG&amp;A expenses equate to roughly 26% of sales, and net income maintains
                    a level of slightly more than 22% of sales.&nbsp; 
                    <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit11.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 11</a></span> 
                    shows the projected balance sheet, which includes a number of assumptions.&nbsp;
                    A 70 day cash and equivalent balance is assumed, while 45.5 days of receivables,
                    61 days of other current assets, and a 4.43 turnover rate of net property and equipment
                    per year are assumed as well.&nbsp; Furthermore,
                    18.24 days of accounts payable, 127.42 days of accrued expenses and 13.56 days of
                    other current liabilities are assumed on the liability side of the balance sheet.
                    &nbsp; These assumptions continue trends in
                    the activity ratios based on historic balance sheet data.&nbsp;
                    The balance sheet shows that Google is expected to have excess cash, which
                    is shown as short term investments, amounting to $9.516 billion in 2007, $9.174
                    billion in 2008, and $8.494 billion in 2009.&nbsp; 
                    Also, retained earnings continue to grow as net income maintains a positive value,
                    while all other items on the balance sheet remain unchanged.&nbsp;
                    <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit12.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 12</a></span> 
                    shows that the activity
                    ratios assumed in the balance sheet are maintained over a 20 year span.&nbsp;
                    Also, Google’s gross profit margin is expected to stay at a level of roughly
                    60% over the next 20 years. &nbsp; Furthermore,
                    the profit ratios show that in 2026, Google is expected to have a return on assets
                    of only 8.6%, and a return on equity of 9.0%, significant decreases from current
                    figures.
