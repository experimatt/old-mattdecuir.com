                Google is growing at an alarming rate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
                As shown in <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit1.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 1</a></span>, Google’s net
                income has grown from $100 million in 2002, to $3.077 billion in 2006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>Google’s common size analysis, <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit2.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 2</a></span>, 
                shows that their net income has fluctuated slightly, but increased overall
                from 22.67% of sales in 2002 to 29.02% of sales in 2006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>Also, cost of goods sold has maintained a level of around 40% of sales, while
                selling, general, and administrative costs have fluctuated around a level of 26%
                of sales.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Earnings before interest
                and taxes have maintained levels of roughly 33-35% of sales, with the exception
                of 2003, which was due to increased SG&amp;A costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>The common size chart shows that cost of goods sold and selling, general,
                and administrative costs fluctuated slightly in 2003 and 2004, but have started
                to level off in recent years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Google’s
                common base analysis, <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit3.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 3</a></span>, shows
                that their sales have grown by 2,412% from 2002 to 2006, while net income has increased
                by more than that, at a rate of 3,088% over the five year period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>Breaking growth down by year, <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit4.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 4</a></span> 
                shows that Google’s sales grew by 233% in 2003, 117% in 2004, 92% in 2005,
                and 72% in 2006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This downward trend
                in growth is not perfectly correlated with net income growth because of the increases
                in economies of scale as Google matures as a company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>Google’s historical balance sheet, as shown in 
                <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit5.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 5</a></span>, 
                shows that Google has a tremendous amount of excess cash, represented
                by significant balances in short term investments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>Furthermore, Google does not have any short term or long term debt, but their
                IPO is reflected by the increase in capital surplus in 2004.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>Furthermore, Google’s capital surplus continued to increase as the share
                price increased along with the number of shares outstanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>Also, because Google is a service-oriented company, there is no inventory
                on hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Google’s ratio analysis, 
                <span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit6.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 6</a></span>, 
                shows that their sales per day have increased from 1.20 in 2002 to 29.05 in 2006.
                &nbsp; Google has had over 100 days of cash on hand in three of the past five years,
                which does not include short-term investments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>This means that Google has more money than they know what to do with, which
                accounts for many of the significant acquisitions recently made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span><span class="mainlink"><a href="exhibit7.aspx" target="_blank">Exhibit 7</a></span> shows that Google’s
                gross profit margin has fluctuated in the past five years, but it has increased
                in each of the past three years, to 60.2% in 2006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>In addition, Google’s return on equity shows a similar trend, increasing
                in the past three years after a steep decline in the first two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>Overall, Google has posted outstanding growth figures in the past five years.
