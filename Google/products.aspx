            The majority of Google’s products are in the form of free
            software, although there are a few exceptions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>These software products are the basis for Google’s end-user services.<span
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These services earn Google a huge daily
            audience, attracting advertisers. 
        </div>
        <div class="mainreport">Google’s revenues come mainly from their advertising services,
            AdWords and AdSense, representing 99% of revenues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Google AdWords are designed to display advertisements relevant to the context
            of each specific web page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Companies
            pay Google to place AdWords on the sites of Google and its affiliates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>On the other hand, Google pays publishers to embed AdSense into their sites.<span
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>AdSense and AdWords both contain the
            same advertisements, but publishers who use AdSense get paid when users click on
            advertisements, while AdWords users pay Google to include their ads on its pages.<span
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Google also offers two pieces of hardware;
            the Google mini and the Google Search Appliance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The Google mini is designed for small companies, while the Google Search
            Appliance is tailored to medium and large businesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Both are rented to companies to facilitate searches within the company intranet,
            or for commercial use on their websites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
        </div>
        <div class="mainreport">
            Google offers a variety of free products and services.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The free products Google offers include
            Gmail, Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheets, Google Desktop, Google Toolbar, Picasa, Google
            Analytics, Google Maps, Google Earth, Google Finance, Google Checkout, Google for
            mobile phones, Youtube, and a variety of search related services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Gmail is a free web-based e-mail client, Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheets include
            free word processing and spreadsheet software for online and offline use, and Google
            Desktop is used for local searches on users’ home computers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Google Maps now have the capacity to show actual satellite images via Google
            Earth, while it also shows current traffic conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In addition, Google has recently added a service called Google Street View,
            which allows for virtual tours of entire cities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Google SMS allows for users to send text messages to 466453 (GOOGLE) with
            queries from their phones searching for topics ranging from weather, sports, or
            local listings, to driving directions and even flight status updates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Google facilitates most of these free services with advertisements, while
            many products are still in beta versions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
            In addition, Google is always developing new and innovative programs through Google
            Labs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the most interesting projects
            from Google Labs is Google Gears, which essentially allows for offline access to
            a variety of online files and pages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
            This project is very important because it may one day rival Microsoft’s Windows
            operating system.
